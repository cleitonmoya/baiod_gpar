# Bayesian Outlier Detection in Generalized Poisson First-Order Autogressive Process

## Abstract
In this work we apply the Bayesian Additive Integer Outlier Detection (BAIOD) proposed by Silva, Pereira and McCabe [Journal of Time Series Analysis, 40(5), 2019] to the Generalized Poisson AR(1) process.
